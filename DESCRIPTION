Description: Extremely fast hashing of R objects using 'xxHash'.  R objects are hashed via
    the standard serialization mechanism in R.  Raw byte vectors and strings
    can be handled directly for compatibility with hashes created on 
    other systems.  This implementation is a wrapper around the 'xxHash' 'C'
    library which is available from <https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash>.
